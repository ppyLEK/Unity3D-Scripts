# Unity3D Scripts

## Small collection of scripts I use most often in my projects.

This repo is mostly for my own convenience but if anyone finds these scripts usefull thats great.

Most of these scripts are old, so I have no idea if they work in newer versions of Unity.
Refer to [Unity Documentation](https://docs.unity.com/) and [C# docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) if these scripts are in need of updating before they are functional.
